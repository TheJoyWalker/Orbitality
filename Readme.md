# Orbitality
this would be a space shooter some day, for now we have:
- primitive planet motion (math)
- missiles do fly using rigidbody2d forces, but no planet influence
- health/damage
- primitive AI (just shoots the closes, there is an idea of path simulation, but I lack physics for now)
- win/loose
- ui quick iteration (I need a better way of handling dependancies)
- pause
- loading/saving
- hud
- pools are disabled and need debugging
- lack weapon types(mocked to first)
- need custom serializers for Vector2 etc..

Generaly I need to update all the utlities - old ones are outdated
